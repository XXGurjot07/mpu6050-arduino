# mpu6050-arduino
These are Sketch files for Arduino Development Platform.
MPU6050 6-Axis IMU along with DMP transfer co-ordinates in Roll_Pitch_Yaw or in Quaternion Form then, those are compared with an threshold value in the loop, then linearly actions/
variable are changed, maybe Motor Control PWM and things like that...</br>
A PROCESSING Sketch is there to monitor Those Variables in Real Time...
